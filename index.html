                <div class="text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-4 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
                    <p>It is difficult to understand the importance of Truth, especially for those who have not yet known the extent of its way. Until one receives this freedom of knowing, the realization that without it, there is no freedom at all. One is otherwise tied to vain imaginations and empty thoughts, until the Truth, that which settles within and radiates outward, brings the whole being to liberty. Only then, do you gain the knowledge of you for you, as you were intended to be - free!</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">‚ÄúAnd you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù John 8:32</p>
                    <p>Until then, there is a dependency on other lofty ideas of self. What can be understood as a debased dependency on self-definition, based on the world`s expectations, a vanity that binds you to a limited way of viewing self and the world around you. This goes on and on, and just when you think you have come through the other side, you enter into yet another web of the same.</p>
                    <p>What seemed like light, dims again; you start the search all over again for something better, something more rewarding, something more fulfilling. But no, the Truth is not in it, the Light is not in it and it ends up taking you back to a place of a new search. A search, you feel is a continuation of self-up-lifting, that requires more intellectual speculation or intuition. You search and sometimes you re-search, contemplating all the odds, you establish another path. You divert and hope that leads you to a finality so you can settle onto something more solid, more rewarding, more fulfilling.</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">Thus says the Lord,‚ÄúStand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, Where the good way is, and walk in it; And you will find rest for your souls. But they said, ‚ÄòWe will not walk in it.‚Äô Jeremiah 6:16</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. Proverbs 3:6</p>
                    <p>This never stops until you stop or are stopped ‚Äì so you expand longitudinally with limited ascence governaned by worldly yardsticks. And when the yardstick shifts, you get back to the drawing table, to the board-room, to the workshop, to the conference, or just introspections. When does this stop? Until, the degenerating mind, body and spirit cages in and then you resign to the time gained or time lost ‚Äì or at the very worst, you lose yourself in it and someone else carries on too.</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death. Proverbs 14:12</p>
                    <p>Of course unless and until you encounter Him ‚ÄìTruth! Until the Truth finds your mind, frees it from all the entrappings of the world`s intellectual reasoning, thus drawing you to a different dimension, the depth of freedom.</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind. 2 Timothy 1:7</p>
                    <p>The turn-around from the webbed mind to this liberated level is instatenous ‚Äì only needed to change the believe system from that of speculation, fear and anxiety to that of certainty and trust. In that instantenous moment, the weight is lifted, like vapour that dissipates into the air never to return in as long as the Truth is sustained and grown into branches of more solidified grounds.</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">‚ÄúIf you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù John 8:31-32</p>
                    <p>Such a clarity is revealed, it becomes like a new pair of eyes ‚Äì eyes of light that penetrate a very sound mind.</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 2 Corinthians 5:17</p>
                    <p>This is the stage where one can say the scales fall off the eyes, the veiling drops and eyes like flames of fire take over. It begins with vanity being dropped off, as one`s imagination gets so enlightened in the Truth, that a transformation takes place that nothing else can replace if sustained by remaining in that elevated ground.</p>
                    <p>Why were eyes that see not seeing? One may ask!</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">And He replied: "Go and tell this people, 'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.' Isaiah 6:9</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">Bring out a people who have eyes but are blind, and who have ears but are deaf. Isaiah 43:8</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">"Hear this, O foolish and senseless people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear. Jeremiah 5:21</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">"Son of man, you are living in a rebellious house. They have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house. Ezekiel 12:2</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the calamity, I plan to bring upon them, each of them will turn from his wicked way. Then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin." Jeremiah 36:3</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. Matthew 13:14</p>
                    <p class="italic text-blue-700">Mark 8:18 Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?' And do you not remember‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>The spiritual blindness - call it lack of understanding, call it foolishness, call it vanity, call it being lost in sinfulness, call it rebellion against Truth!</p>
                    <p>We each have the Holy Spirit in us as our guide, teacher and advocate and counsellor. John 14:26-27. The righteousness of Christ in us shall prosper us, when we believe. I work with the Holy Spirit's instructions. I am also a trained intermediary and biblical counsellor.</p>
                    <p>My spiritual journey begins from 10th October 2019.</p>

Only my Word shall open the eyes of the holy ones who have been sanctified by the Blood and in Truth for I give unto them my discernment. Seeing is not believing anymore- you shall now see by discerning by the Spirit your Helper. That I Jehovah YHWH have given you.</p>
                    <p>Do you not see that my Commandments are based on choices made by these senses ‚Äì the world is governed and misled by sense. Release all senses that cause the feelings that can cause you to sin.</p>
                    <p>Choose to take in only that which I have ordered you.</p>
                    <p>Don‚Äôt go by feelings as the days ahead will not need feelings - feelings cause you fear and confusion and doubt ‚Äì cast everything and soak only in the blood and spirit.. therein lies your protection in the days to come.</p>
                    <p>For was my Son Jesus not tempted by sight, by feelings , but did He not stand by my Word and Truth and my Word came to pass.</p>
                    <p>Sin is laden with choice, choice is laden by feelings unless one walks in the Spirit you will not understand the difference.</p>
                    <p>Again I say your body is my temple where I dwell, Your Most High God. How then can we walk by sight. We are guided on the path by Truth and through the Spirit.</p>
                    <p>Release yourself - Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore, honor God with your bodies.</p>
                    <p class="italic">‚Äú The eye is the lamp of the body . If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! Matthew 6:22-23.</p>
                    <p>God`s Temple is sacred and You Together are that Temple. And I do not dwell in sin.</p>
